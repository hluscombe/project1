# Sine.

Sine is a database that allows Synthesiser designers to create a profile and link themselves to synthesisers they have designed. From there anyone can link a synthesiser with a band that has used it, with the ultimate goal of displaying how the synthesiser has been used in recordings and providing more information about the people that have both designed them and used them.
